### Mission Statement
As an owner of a butcher shop,
I want a website that shows off our brand and stands out from our competition.
I need a website with these pages:
* Homepage with:
    - Hero Image, Section with information and a link to our products page, and a contact section with our information
* Products Page with:
    - A simple menu that lists our products
* About Us Page with:
    - Pictures with grandpa, etc
    - More info on backstory
    - Our Values Section
        - Icons and text with each value we uphold

## Future Developments:
In the future, I hope to add more functionality to the website. Some ideas that I had was to include:
* Calendar with dates of free samples, cookouts, and other events.
* Generate links to get recipes from an API.
* Online ordering.
